# Capstone Project 

# Purpose 
The purpose of my code is to create a system where you can purchase everything you need to crochet your desired project. The algorithum will give you a set of projects and supples that you would possibly need. 

# Target Audience 
The target audience is anyone who has a passion for creativity, bringing designs to life and looking to find a site that has everything they need to create their desired project. 

# Solutions
Some solutions that this site solves is having avalibility towards any crochet nesseccities you may need. The site always provides different project options with an estimation of how much yarn would be needed. Another solution is having the opportunity to pay less during purchases, so you are always getting your moneys worth! 

# Key feautures 
Some key feautures are while loops, if statements, random.choice, .append, and strings. These feautures are what held the program together to give the user the ability to type in something and get a response in the end. In the beginning of my code I used #importrandom to be able to import strings and get a random response from the algorithm. Alongside that I created a while loop to give the user a chance to answer questions and get a response in return. 

# Technical Challenges 
A technical challenge that I experienced was pricing logic. With having different options of projects, rolls of yarn, and colorization I programed the system to be an exstimation of what the total would possibly be if your desired project was purchased. For futuristic opportunities I will make the pricing more logical. Another challenge I experienced was improper referencing towards my variables. Throughout my code I made minor mistakes that I could have easily avodied by paying attention to what I wrote in the pervious lines. (***SHOW BEBFORE AND AFTER OF PROPER AND IMPROPER CODE.***) The last technical challenge I experienced was data inconsistancy, (rolls_of_yarn_options) is a string but should have been an integer to aviod confusion with math operations. 

# Future Plans 
Throughout the process of creating my project I connected with it deeply because I am someone who has a passion for crocheting. When I discovered crocheting it was difficult to find the materials I needed because most stores either dont have it or are extremely overpriced. I wanted to provide a system where you can find all of your materials on one platform at the lowest rate possible.
