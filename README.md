# Capstone Project 

# Purpose 
The purpose of my code is to create a system where you can purchase everything you need to crochet your desired project. The algorithum will give you a set of projects and supples that you would possibly need. 

# Target Audience 
The target audience is anyone who has a passion for creativity, bringing designs to life and looking to find a site that has everything they need to create their desired project. 

# Solutions
Some solutions that this site solves is having avalibility towards any crochet nesseccities you may need. The site always provides different project options with an estimation of how much yarn would be needed. Another solution is having the opportunity to pay less during purchases, so you are always getting your moneys worth! 

# Key feautures 
Some key feautures are while loops, if statements, random.choice, .append, and strings. These feautures are what held the program together to give the user the ability to type in something and get a response in the end. In the beginning of my code I used #importrandom to be able to import strings and get a random response from the algorithm. Alongside that I created a while loop to give the user a chance to answer questions and get a response in return.
